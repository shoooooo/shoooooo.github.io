<h1>2015 Fall CTP431 Final Project Documentation</h1>
<h2><b>CHOI Kweon / 20090947</b><h2>
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A musical interface built from javascript web audio API</p>
<p>You can move white circle with mouse, and hexagonal blocks under the circle plays tone when you click.</p>
<p>You can play triad chords by covering 3 blocks at once</p>
<br>
<h2>More Description</h2>

<p><b> Isomorphic Keyboard</b></p>

<p>It seems like accordion keys, but the layout is different. This layout is built to play triad chords easier.</p>
<p>If you choose any of adjacent three blocks, they will make a major/minor triad.</p>
<p>Just like other isomorphic keyboards, you can change your music's key by moving your hand in parallel.</p>
<p>You can play continuous change of chords by clicking and dragging.</p>

<p><b> Sound Design</b></p>

<p>To make all keys sound equal, notes are in Shepard tone.</p>
<p>Bell-shaped filter and its graph for the tone : <br>
y = (0.5+0.5*sin((log(f)-log(130.8))*2*pi/(log(1688)-log(130.8))-pi/2))*1.5*130.8^2/f^2</p>
<img src = "bell.png">
<p>ADSR envelope : <br>
A = 10ms / D = 700ms / S = 77% / R = 100ms</p>
<p>Sound gain level for each key : <br>
G = a-2*d/3 (d<1.5a) <br>
G = 0 (d>1.5a) <br>
(d is distance between the center of a key and the center of white circle) <br>
(a is the length of side of hexagons)</p>
<br>
<h2>Further improvement</h2>

<p>Parameter control for sound design</p>
<p>Mapping mouse position to panning/sound tone</p>
<p>iPad app that support multitouch</p>
<p>Giving a good name for the project/app</p>
